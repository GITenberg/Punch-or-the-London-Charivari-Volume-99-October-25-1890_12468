    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[On the paper in which the MS. of this novel was
        wrapped, the following note was written in a bold feminine
        hand:&mdash;"This is a highly religious story. GEORGE ELIOT
        was unable to write properly about religion. The novel is
        certain to be well reviewed. It is calculated to adorn the
        study-table of a Bishop. The &pound;1000 prize must be
        handed over at once to the Institute which is to be founded
        to encourage new religions in the alleys of St.

    </blockquote>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <p>It was evening&mdash;evening in Oxford. There are evenings
    in other places occasionally. Cambridge sometimes puts forward
    weak imitations. But, on the whole, there are no evenings which
    have so much of the true, inward, mystic spirit as Oxford
    evenings. A solemn hush broods over the grey quadrangles, and
    this, too, in spite of the happy laughter of the undergraduates
    playing touch last on the grass-plots, and leaping, like a
    merry army of marsh-dwellers, each over the back of the other,
    on their way to the deeply impressive services of their
    respective college chapels. Inside, the organs were pealing
    majestically, in response to the deft fingers of many highly
    respectable musicians, and all the proud traditions, the
    legendary struggles, the well-loved examinations, the
    affectionate memories of generations of proctorial officers,
    the innocent rustications, the warning appeals of authoritative
    Deans&mdash;all these seemed gathered together into one last
    loud trumpet-call, as a tall, impressionable youth, carrying
    with him a spasm of feeling, a Celtic temperament, a moved,
    flashing look, and a surplice many sizes too large for him,
    dashed with a kind of quivering, breathless sigh, into the
    chapel of St. Boniface's just as the porter was about to close
    the door. This was ROBERT, or, as his friends lovingly called
    him, BOB SILLIMERE. His mother had been an Irish lady, full of
    the best Irish humour; after a short trial, she was, however,
    found to be a superfluous character, and as she began to
    develop differences with CATHERINE, she caught an acute
    inflammation of the lungs, and died after a few days, in the
    eleventh chapter.</p>

    </div>

    <p>BOB sat still awhile, his agitation soothed by the
    comforting sense of the oaken seat beneath him. At school he
    had been called by his school-fellows "the Knitting-needle," a
    remarkable example of the well-known fondness of boys for
    sharp, short nicknames; but this did not trouble him now. He
    and his eagerness, his boundless curiosity, and his lovable
    mistakes, were now part and parcel of the new life of
    Oxford&mdash;new to him, but old as the ages, that, with their
    rhythmic recurrent flow, like the pulse of&mdash;[<i>Two pages
    of fancy writing are here omitted.</i> ED.] BRIGHAM and BLACK
    were in chapel, too. They were Dons, older than BOB, but his
    intimate friends. They had but little belief, but BLACK often
    preached, and BRIGHAM held undecided views on life and
    matrimony, having been brought up in the cramped atmosphere of
    a middle-class parlour. At Oxford, the two took pupils, and
    helped to shape BOB's life. Once BRIGHAM had pretended, as an
    act or pure benevolence, to be a Pro-Proctor, but as he had a
    sardonic scorn, and a face which could become a marble mask,
    the Vice-Chancellor called upon him to resign his position, and
    he never afterwards repeated the experiment.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>One evening BOB was wandering dreamily on the banks of the
    Upper River. He sat down, and thought deeply. Opposite to him
    was a wide green expanse dotted with white patches of geese.
    There and then, by the gliding river, with a mass of reeds and
    a few poplars to fill in the landscape, he determined to become
    a clergyman. How strange that he should never have thought of
    this before; how sudden it was; how wonderful! But the die was
    cast; <i>alea jacta est</i>, as he had read yesterday in an
    early edition of St. Augustine; and, when BOB rose, there was a
    new brightness in his eye, and a fresh springiness in his
    steps. And at that moment the deep bell of St.
    Mary's&mdash;[<i>Three pages omitted.</i> ED.]</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>And thus BOB was ordained, and, having married CATHERINE, he
    accepted the family living of Wendover, though not before he
    had taken occasion to point out to BLACK that family livings
    were corrupt and indefensible institutions. Still, the thing
    had to be done; and bitterly as BOB pined for the bracing air
    of the East End of London, he acknowledged, with one of his
    quick, bright flashes, that, unless he went to Wendover, he
    could never meet Squire MUREWELL, whose powerful arguments were
    to drive him from positions he had never qualified himself,
    except by an irrational enthusiasm, to defend. Of CATHERINE a
    word must be said. Cold, with the delicate but austere firmness
    of a Westmoreland daisy, gifted with fatally sharp lines about
    the chin and mouth, and habitually wearing loose grey gowns,
    with bodices to match, she was admirably calculated, with her
    narrow, meat-tea proclivities, to embitter the amiable
    SILLIMERE's existence, and to produce, in conjunction with him,
    that storm and stress, that perpetual clashing of two estimates
    without which no modern religious novel could be written, and
    which not even her pale virginal grace of look and form could
    subdue. That is a long sentence, but, ah! how short is a merely
    mortal sentence, with its tyrannous full stop, against the
    immeasurable background of the December stars, by whose light
    BOB was now walking, with heightened colour, along the vast
    avenue that led to Wendover Hall, the residence of the ogre
    Squire.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>The Squire was at home. On the door-step BOB was greeted by
    Mrs. FARCEY, the Squire's sister. She looked at him in her
    bird-like way. At other times she was elf-like, and played
    tricks with a lace handkerchief.</p>

    <p>"You know," she whispered to BOB, "we're all mad here. I'm
    mad, and he," she continued, bobbing diminutively towards the
    Squire's study-door, "he's mad too&mdash;as mad as a
    hatter."</p>

    <p>Before BOB had time to answer this strange remark, the
    study-door flew open, and Squire MUREWELL stepped forth. He
    rapped out an oath or two, which BOB noticed with faint
    politeness, and ordered his visitor to enter. The Squire was
    rough&mdash;very rough; but he had studied hard in Germany.</p>

    <p>"So you're the young fool," he observed, "who intends to
    tackle me. Ha, ha, that's a good joke. I'll have you round my
    little finger in two twos. Here," he went on gruffly, "take
    this book of mine in your right hand. Throw your eyes up to the
    ceiling." ROBERT, wishing to conciliate him, did as he desired.
    The eyes stuck there, and looked down with a quick lovable look
    on the two men below. "Now," said the Squire, "you can't see.
    Pronounce the word 'testimony' twice, slowly. Think of a
    number, multiply by four, subtract the Thirty-nine Articles,
    add a Sunday School and a packet of buns. Result, you're a
    freethinker." And with that he bowed BOB out of the room.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

    <p>A terrible storm was raging in the Rector's breast as he
    strode, regardless of the cold, along the verdant lanes of
    Wendover. "Fool that I was!" he muttered, pressing both hands
    convulsively to his sides. "Why did I not pay more attention to
    arithmetic at school? I could have crushed him, but I was
    ignorant. Was that result right?" He reflected awhile
    mournfully, but he could bring it out in no other way. "I must
    go through with it to the bitter end," he concluded, "and
    CATHERINE must be told." But the thought of CATHERINE knitting
    quietly at home, while she read Fox's <i>Book of Martyrs</i>,
    with a tender smile on her thin lips, unmanned him. He sobbed
    bitterly. The front-door of the Rectory was open. He walked
    in.&mdash;The rest is soon told. He resigned the Rectory, and
    made a brand-new religion. CATHERINE frowned, but it was
    useless. Thereupon she gave him cold bacon for lunch during a
    whole fortnight, and the brave young soul which had endured so
    much withered under this blight. And thus, acknowledging the
    novelist's artistic necessity, ROBERT died.&mdash;[THE
    END.]</p>
    <hr />

    <p>WINTER SEASON AT COVENT GARDEN.&mdash;Opening of Italian
    Opera last Saturday, with <i>Aida</i>. Very well done. "Wait"
    between Second and Third Act too long: "Waiters" in Gallery
    whistling. Wind whistling, too, in Stalls. Operatic and
    rheumatic. Rugs and fur capes might be kept on hire by
    Stall-keepers. Airs in <i>Aida</i> delightful: draughts in
    Stalls awful. Signor LAGO called before Curtain to receive
    First Night congratulations. Signor LAGO ought to do good
    business "in front," as there's evidently no difficulty in
    "raising the wind."</p>

    <h4>(<i>With acknowledgments to Monk Lewis and the Authors of
    "Rejected Addresses."</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"No hardship would be inflicted upon manufacturers, if
        dangerous trades in general were subjected to such a
        supervision as would afford the largest attainable measure
        of security to all engaged in them. The case is one which
        urgently demands the consideration of Parliament, not only
        for the protection of work-people, but even for the
        protection of the Metropolis itself. It should never be
        forgotten that fire constitutes the gravest risk to which

    <p><i>The Exhibitor</i> (<i>in a confidential tone, punctuated

    Gentlemen, but at once proceed with a few preliminary remarks.
    Most of you, no doubt, have read that celebrated story by Mr.
    RIDER HAGGARD, about a certain <i>She-who-must-be-obeyed</i>,
    and who dwelt in a place called K&ocirc;r, and you will also
    doubtless remember how she was in the 'abit of repairing, at
    certain intervals, to a cavern, and renooing her youth in a
    fiery piller. On one occasion, wishing to indooce her lover to
    foller her example, she stepped into the flame to encourage
    him&mdash;something went wrong with the works, and she was
    instantly redooced to a cinder. I fortunately 'appened to be
    near at the time (you will escuse a little wild fib from a
    showman, I'm sure!) I 'appened to be porsin by, and was thus
    enabled to secure the ashes of the Wonderful She,
    which&mdash;(<i>draws hangings and reveals a shallow metal Urn
    suspended in the centre of scene</i>), are now before you
    enclosed in that little urn. She&mdash;where are you?</p>

    <p><i>She</i> (<i>in a full sweet voice, from below</i>). I am
    'ere!</p>

    <p><i>Showman</i>. Then appear!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The upper portion of an exceedingly comely Young
        Person emerges from the mouth of the Urn.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The F.S.</i> (<i>startled</i>). Lor, she give me quite a
    turn!</p>

    <p><i>Showman</i>. Some people think this is all done by
    mirrors, but it is not so; it is managed by a simple
    arrangement of light and shade. She will now turn slowly round,
    to convince you that she is really inside the urn and not
    merely beyind it. (She <i>turns round condescendingly.</i>) She
    will next pass her 'ands completely round her, thereby
    demonstrating the utter impossibility of there being any wires
    to support her. Now she will rap on the walls on each side of
    her, proving to you that she is no reflection, but a solid
    reality, after which she will tap the bottom of the urn beneath
    her, so that you may see it really is what it purports to be.
    (She <i>performs all these actions in the most obliging
    manner</i>.) She will now disappear for a moment. (She <i>sinks
    into the Urn.</i>) Are you still there, She?</p>

    <p><i>She</i> (<i>from the recess of the Urn</i>). Yes.</p>

    <p><i>Showman</i>. Then will you give us some sign of your
    presence! (<i>A hand and arm are protruded, and waved
    gracefully.</i>) Thank you. Now you can come up again. (She
    <i>re-appears.</i>) She will now answer any questions any lady
    or gentleman may like to put to her, always provided you won't
    ask her how it is done&mdash;for I'm sure she wouldn't give me
    away, <i>would</i> you, She?</p>

    <p><i>She</i> (<i>with a slow bow and gracious smile</i>).
    Certingly not.</p>

    <p><i>The F.S.</i> (<i>to her Companion</i>). Ask her
    something&mdash;do.</p>

    <p><i>Her Comp.</i> Go on! <i>I</i> ain't got anything to ask
    her&mdash;ask her yourself!</p>

    <i>feet</i> warm?</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. Quite&mdash;thanks.</p>

    <p><i>The Showman</i>. How old are you, She?</p>

    <p><i>She</i> (<i>impressively</i>). Two theousand years.</p>

    <p><i>'Arry.</i> And quite a young thing, too!</p>

    <p><i>A Spectator</i> (<i>who has read the Novel</i>). 'Ave you
    'eard from LEO VINCEY lately?</p>

    <p><i>She</i> (<i>coldly</i>). I don't know the gentleman.</p>

    <p><i>Showman</i>. If you have no more questions to ask her,
    She will now retire into her urn, thanking you all for your
    kind attendance this morning, which will conclude the
    entertainment.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Final disappearance of</i> She. <i>The Audience pass

    Adulteration. At any rate, if the customer chooses to purchase
    butter which is <i>not</i> butter, he shall do it knowingly,
    with his eyes open. (<i>Feeble "Hear, hear!"</i>) Under this

    <p><i>Butterman</i> (<i>loftily</i>). Now look here, my man,

    <h2>TO ENGELBERG AND BACK.</h2>

    <h4><i>Being a few Notes taken en route in search of a Perfect
    Cure.</i></h4>

    <p>The Engineers who constructed the gradually ascending road
    which, slowly mounting the valley, finally takes you over the
    ridge, as it were, and deposits you at a height of 3800 feet,
    dusty but grateful, on the plain of Engelberg, must have been
    practical jokers of the first water. They lead you up in the
    right direction several thousand feet, then suddenly turn you
    round, and apparently take you clean back again. And this not
    once, but a dozen times. They seem to say, "You think you must
    reach the top <i>this</i> time, my fine fellow? Not a bit of
    it. Back you go again."</p>

    <p>Still we kept turning and turning whither the
    Practical-joking Engineers led us, but seemed as far off from
    our journey's end as ever. A roadside inn for a moment deluded
    us with its light, but we only drew up in front of this while
    our gloomy charioteer sat down to a good square meal, the third
    he had had since three o'clock, over which he consumed exactly
    five-and-twenty minutes, keeping us waiting while he disposed
    of it at his leisure, in a fit of depressing but greedy
    sulks.</p>

    <p>At length we moved on again, and in about another
    half-an-hour apparently reached the limit of the
    Practical-joking Engineers' work, for our surly charioteer
    suddenly jumped on the box, and cracking his whip furiously,
    got all the pace that was left in them out of our three
    sagacious horses, and in a few more minutes we were tearing
    along a level road past scattered <i>ch&acirc;lets</i>, little
    wooden toy-shops, and isolated <i>pensions</i>, towards a
    colossal-looking white palace that stood out a grateful sight
    in the distance before us, basking in the calm white-blue blaze
    shed upon it from a couple of lofty electric lights, that told
    us that up here in the mountains we were not coming to rough
    it, but to be welcomed by the latest luxuries and refinements
    of first-rate modern hotel accommodation. And this proved to be
    the case. Immediately he arrived in the large entrance-hall,
    the Dilapidated One was greeted by the Landlord of the Hotel et
    Kurhaus, Titlis, politely assisted to the lift, and finally
    deposited in the comfortable and electrically-lighted room
    which had been assigned to him.</p>

    <p>"We are extremely full," announced the polite Herr to Dr.
    MELCHISIDEC; "and we just come from finishing the second
    dinner,"&mdash;which seemed to account for his being "extremely
    full,"&mdash;"but as soon as you will descend from your rooms,
    there will be supper ready at your disposition."</p>

    <p>"You'll just come and look at the Bath-chair before you turn
    in?" inquired Dr. MELCHISIDEC, of the Dilapidated One, "It's
    arrived all right from Zurich. Come by post, apparently."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's nothing," continued young JERRYMAN, "why,
    there's nothing you can't send by post in Switzerland, from a
    house full of furniture, down to a grand piano or cage of
    canaries. You've only got to clap a postage-stamp on it, and
    there you are!" And the arrival of the Bath-chair certainly
    seemed to indicate that he was telling something very like the
    truth.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"I don't quite see how this guiding-wheel is to act,"
    remarked Dr. MELCHISIDEC, examining the chair, which was of
    rather pantomimic proportions, critically; "but suppose you
    just get in and try it! 'Pon my word it almost looks like a
    'trick-chair'!" which indeed it proved itself to be, jerking up
    in a most unaccountable fashion the moment the Dilapidated One
    put his foot into it, and unceremoniously sending him flying
    out on to his head forthwith. "A little awkward at first," he
    remarked, assisting the Dilapidated One on to his feet. "One
    has to get accustomed to these things, you see; but, bless you,
    in a day or two you won't want it at all. You'll find the air
    here like a continual draught of champagne. 'Pon my word, I
    believe you feel better already," and with this inspiriting
    assurance the Dilapidated One, who had not only covered himself
    with dust, but severely bruised his shins, saying that "he
    thought, perhaps, he did&mdash;just a little," was again
    assisted to the lift, and safely consigned to his room, where
    he was comfortably packed away for the night.</p>

    <p>"I say," says young JERRYMAN, next morning, "what a place
    for bells!"</p>

    <p>And young JERRYMAN was right, for I was awoke in the small
    hours of the morning by a loud peal from the Monastery, as if
    the Prior had suddenly said to himself, "What's the use of the
    bells if you don't ring 'em? By Jove, I will!" and had then and
    there jumped from his couch, seized hold of the ropes, and set
    to work with a right good will. Then the hotels and
    <i>pensions</i> took it up, and so, what with seven o'clock,
    eight o'clock, and nine o'clock breakfasts, first and second
    <i>d&eacute;jeuners</i>, first and second dinners, interspersed
    with "Office Hours" sounded by the Monastery, and the sound of
    the dinner-bells carried by the cattle, Dingle-berg, rather
    than Engelberg, would be a highly appropriate name for this
    somewhat noisy, but otherwise delightful health-resort.</p>

    <p>"I call this 'fatal dull' after Paris," remarked a fair
    Americaine to young JERRYMAN; and, perhaps, from a certain
    point of view, she may have been right; but, fatal dull, or
    lively, there can be no two opinions about the life-giving
    properties of the air.</p>

    <p>OLD JOE ENCORE.&mdash;Last Wednesday in the FARRAR <i>v.</i>
    Publisher discussion, a Correspondent, signing himself JOHN
    TAYLOR, of Dagnall Park, Selhurst, wrote to <i>The Times</i> to
    "quote an anecdote" about DOUGLAS JERROLD and "a Publisher."
    Rarely has a good old story been so spoilt in the telling as in
    this instance. The true story is of ALBERT SMITH and DOUGLAS
    JERROLD, and has been already told in the <i>Times</i> by a
    Correspondent signing himself "E.Y." It is of the same
    respectable age as that one of ALBERT SMITH signing his
    initials "A.S.," and JERROLD observing, "He only tells
    two-thirds of the truth." Perhaps Mr. JOHN TAYLOR, of Dagnall
    Park, Selhurst, is going to favour us with a little volume of
    "new sayings by old worthies" at Christmas time, and we shall
    hear how SHERIDAN once asked TOM B&mdash;&mdash; "why a miller
    wore a white hat?" And how ERSKINE, on hearing a witness's
    evidence about a door being open, explained to him that his
    evidence would be worthless, because a door could not be
    considered as a door "if it were a jar," and several other
    excellent stories, which, being told for the first time with
    the <i>verve</i> and local colouring of which the writer of the
    letter to <i>The Times</i> is evidently a past-master, will
    secure for the little work an enormous popularity.</p>

    <p>A SCOTT AND A LOT.&mdash;"Thirty Years at the Play" is the
    title of Mr. CLEMENT SCOTT's Lecture to be delivered next
    Saturday at the Garrick Theatre, for the benefit of the Actors'
    Benevolent Fund. Thirty years of Play-time! All play, and lots
    of work. Mr. IRVING is to introduce the lecturer to his
    audience, who, up to that moment, will have been "Strangers
    Yet," and this CLEMENT will be SCOTT-free to say what he likes,
    and to tell 'em all about it generally. "SCOTT" will be on the
    stage, and the "Lot" in the auditorium. Lot's Wife also.</p>

    <p>ETHER-DRINKING IN IRELAND.&mdash;Mr. ERNEST HART (bless his
    heart and earnestness!) lectured last week on "Ether-Drinking
    in Ireland." He lectured "The Society for the Study of
    Inebriety"&mdash;a Society which must be slightly
    "mixed"&mdash;on this bad habit, and no doubt implored them to
    give it up. The party sang, "<i>How Happy could we be with
    Ether</i>" and the discussion was continued until there was

    <p>RUM FROM JAMAICA&mdash;VERY.&mdash;When "the bauble" was
    removed from the table of the House, by order of OLIVER
    CROMWELL, it was sent with somebody's compliments at a later
    date to Jamaica, and placed on the Parliament table. What
    became of it nobody knows. It is supposed that this ensign of
    ancient British Royalty was swallowed up by an earthquake of
    republican tendencies. Jamaica, of course, is a great place for
    spices; but, in spite of all the highly spiced stories, the
    origin of which is more or less aus-spice-ious, it is to be
    regretted that, up to the present moment, what gave them their
    peculiar flavour, <i>i.e.</i>, the original Mace, cannot be
    found.</p>

    <p>When some years ago EDMUNDUS ED. MUNDI first introduced to
    London the gentle art of Interviewing, the idea was in a
    general way a novelty in this country. It "caught on," and
    achieved success. Some public men affected, privately, not to
    like the extra publicity given to their words and actions; but
    it was only an affectation, and in a general way a great many
    suddenly found themselves dubbed "Celebrities," hall-marked as
    such by <i>The World</i>, and able therefore to hand themselves
    down to posterity, in bound volumes containing this one
    invaluable number as having been recognised by the world at
    large as undoubted Celebrities, ignorance of whose existence
    would argue utter social insignificance. So great was the
    <i>World's</i> success in this particular line, that at once
    there sprang up a host of imitators, and the Celebrities were
    again tempted to make themselves still more celebrated by
    having good-natured caricatures of themselves made by "Age" and
    "Spy." After this, the deluge, of biographies, autobiographies,
    interviewings, photographic realities, portraits plain and
    coloured&mdash;many of them uncommonly plain, and some of them
    wonderfully coloured,&mdash;until a Celebrity who has
    <i>not</i> been done and served up, with or without a plate, is
    a Celebrity indeed.</p>

    <p>"Celebrities" have hitherto been valuable to the
    interviewer, photographer, and proprietor of a Magazine in due
    proportion. Is it not high time that the Celebrities themselves
    have a slice or two out of the cake? If they consent to sit as
    models to the interviewer and photographer, let them price
    their own time. The Baron offers a model of correspondence on
    both sides, and, if his example is followed, up goes the price
    of "Celebrities," and, consequently, of interviewed and
    interviewers, there will be only a survival of the fittest.</p>

    Dramatic and Artistic Notabilities of the present day, and
    feeling that the work which has now reached its
    hundred-and-second number, would indeed be incomplete did it
    not include <i>your</i> name, the above-mentioned firm has
    commissioned me to request you to accord me an interview as
    soon as possible. I propose bringing with me an eminent
    photographer, and also an artist who will make a sketch of your
    surroundings, and so contribute towards producing a complete
    picture which cannot fail to interest and delight the thousands
    at home and abroad, to whom your name is as a household word,
    and who will be delighted to possess a portrait of one whose
    works have given them so much pleasure, and to obtain a closer
    and more intimate acquaintance with the <i>modus operandi</i>
    pursued by one of their most favourite authors.</p>

    <p>I remain, Sir, yours truly,</p>

    <p>A. SOPHTE SOPER.</p>

    <h4><i>From the Baron de Book-Worms to A. Sophte Soper,

    <p>DEAB SIR,&mdash;Thanks. I quite appreciate your
    appreciation. My terms for an article in a Magazine, are twenty
    guineas the first hour, ten guineas the second, and so on. For
    dinner-table anecdotes, the property in which once made public
    is lost for ever to the originator, special terms. As to
    photographs, I will sign every copy, and take twopence on every
    copy. I'm a little pressed for time now, so if you can manage
    it, we will defer the visit for a week or two, and then I'm
    your man.</p>

    <p>Yours truly,</p>

    <p>BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <h4><i>Mr. A. Sophte Soper to the Baron de Book-Worms.</i></h4>

    <p>MY DEAR BARON,&mdash;I'm afraid I didn't quite make myself
    understood. I did not ask <i>you</i> to write the article,
    being commissioned by the firm to do it myself. The photographs
    will not be sold apart from the Magazine. Awaiting your
    favourable response,&mdash;</p>

    <p>I am, Sir, Yours,</p>

    <p>A. SOPHTE SOPER.</p>

    <h4><i>From the Baron to A. Sophte Soper.</i></h4>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;I <i>quite</i> understood. With the generous
    view of doing me a good turn by giving me the almost
    inestimable advantage of advertising myself in Messrs. TOWERS
    &amp; Co.'s widely-circulated Magazine, you propose to
    interview me, and receive from me such orally given information
    as you may require concerning my life, history, work, and
    everything about myself which, in your opinion, would interest
    the readers of this Magazine. I quite appreciate all this. You
    propose to write the article, <i>and I'm to find you the
    materials for it</i>. Good. I don't venture to put any price on
    the admirable work which your talent will produce,&mdash;that's
    for you and your publishers to settle between you, and, as a
    matter of fact, it has been already settled, as you are in
    their employ. But I <i>can</i> put a price on my own, and I do.
    I collaborate with you in furnishing all the materials of which
    you are in need. <i>Soit.</i> For the use of my Pegasus, no
    matter what its breed, and, as it isn't a gift-horse, but a
    hired one, you can examine its mouth and legs critically
    whenever you are going to mount and guide it at your own sweet
    will, <i>I charge twenty guineas for the first hour</i>, and
    <i>ten for the second</i>. It may be dear, or it may be cheap.
    That's not my affair. <i>C'est &agrave; laisser ou &agrave;
    prendre.</i></p>

    <p>The Magazine in which the article is to appear is not given
    away with a pound of tea, or anything of that sort I presume,
    so that your strictly honourable and business-like firm of
    employers, and you also, Sir, in the regular course of your
    relations with them, intend making something out of me, more or
    less, but something, while I get nothing at all for my time,
    which is decidedly as valuable to me as, I presume, is yours to
    you. What have your publishers ever done for me that I should
    give them my work for nothing? Time is money; why should I make
    Messrs. TOWER, FONDLER &amp; Co. a present of twenty pounds,
    or, for the matter of that, even ten shillings? If I
    misapprehend the situation, and you are doing your work gratis
    and for the love of the thing, then that is <i>your</i> affair,
    not mine: I'm glad to hear it, and regret my inability to join
    you in the luxury of giving away what it is an imperative
    necessity of my existence to sell at the best price I can. Do
    you honestly imagine, Sir, that my literary position will be
    one farthing's-worth improved by a memoir and a portrait of me
    appearing in your widely-circulated journal? If <i>you</i> do,
    <i>I don't</i>; and I prefer to be paid for my work, whether I
    dictate the material to a scribe, who is to serve it up in his
    own fashion, or whether I write it myself. And now I come to
    consider it, I should be inclined to make an additional charge
    for <i>not</i> writing it myself, Not to take you and your
    worthy firm of employers by surprise, I will make out
    beforehand a supposititious bill, and then Messrs. TOWER &amp;
    Co. can close with my offer or not, as they please.</p>

    <p>To the above a reply may be expected, and, if received, it
    will probably be in a different tone from Mr. SOPHTE SOPER's
    previous communications. No matter. There's an end of it. The

    themselves to be interviewed, is, in the language of the
    poet,&mdash;</p>

    <p>then they will have benefited other Celebrities all round,
    and the result will be that either only those authors will be
    interviewed who are worth the price of interviewing, or the
    professional biographical compilers will have to hunt up
    nobodies, dress up jays as peacocks, and so bring the
    legitimate business of "Interviewing" into well-deserved
    contempt.</p>

    <h2>SERVED &Agrave; LA RUSSE.</h2>

    <p>MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>Will you allow me, as one who knows Russia by heart, to
    express my intense admiration for the new piece at the
    Shaftesbury Theatre, in which is given, in my opinion, the most
    faithful picture of the CZAR's dominions as yet exhibited to
    the British Public. ACT I. is devoted to "a Street near the
    Banks of the Neva, St. Petersburg," and here we have a splendid
    view of the Winter Palace, and what I took to be the Kremlin at
    Moscow. On one side is the house of a money-lender, and on the
    other the shelter afforded to a drosky-driver and his starving
    family. The author, whose name must be BUCHANANOFF (though he
    modestly drops the ultimate syllable), gives as a second title
    to this portion of his wonderful work, "The Dirge for the
    Dead." It is very appropriate. A student, whose funds are at
    the lowest ebb, commits a purposeless murder, and a "pope" who
    has been on the look-out no doubt for years, seizes the
    opportunity to rush into the murdered man's dwelling, and sing
    over his inanimate body a little thing of his own composition.
    Anyone who has been in Russia will immediately recognise this
    incident as absolutely true to life. Amongst my own
    acquaintance I know three priests who did precisely the same
    thing&mdash;they are called BROWNOFF, JONESKI, and
    ROBINSONOFF.</p>

    <p>Next we have the Palace of the <i>Princess Orenburg</i>, and
    make the acquaintance of <i>Anna Ivanovna</i>, a young lady who
    is the sister of the aimless murderer, and owner of untold
    riches. We are also introduced to the Head of Police, who, as
    everyone knows, is a cross between a suburban inspector, a
    low-class inquiry agent, and a <i>flaneur</i> moving in the
    best Society. We find, too, naturally enough, an English
    <i>attach&eacute;</i>, whose chief aim is to insult an aged
    Russian General, whose <i>sobriquet</i> is, "the Hero of
    Sebastopol." Then the aimless murderer reveals his crime,
    which, of course, escapes detection save at the hands of
    <i>Prince Zosimoff</i>, a nobleman, who I fancy, from his name,
    must have discovered a new kind of tooth-powder.</p>

    <p>Next we have the "Interior of a Common Lodging House," the
    counterpart of which may be found in almost any street in the
    modern capital of Russia. There are the religious pictures, the
    cathedral immediately opposite, with its stained-glass windows
    and intermittent organ, and the air of sanctity without which
    no Russian Common Lodging House is complete. Needless to say
    that <i>Prince Tooth-powder</i>&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;and
    <i>Anna</i> listen while <i>Fedor Ivanovitch</i> again
    confesses his crime, this time to the daughter of the
    drosky-driver, for whom he has a sincere regard, and I may add,
    affection. Although with a well-timed scream his sister might
    interrupt the awkward avowal, she prefers to listen to the
    bitter end. This reminds me of several cases recorded in the
    <i>Newgatekoff Calendaroff</i>, a miscellany of Russian
    crimes.</p>

    <p>After this we come to the Gardens of the Palace Taurida,
    when <i>Fedor</i> is at length arrested and carted off to
    Siberia, an excellent picture of which is given in the last
    Act. Those who <i>really</i> know Russian Society-will not be
    surprised to find that the Chief of the Police (promoted to a
    new position and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
       id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span> a fur-trimmed coat), and
       the principal characters of the drama have also found their
       way to the Military Outpost on the borders of the dreaded
       region. I say dreaded, but should have added, without cause.
       M. BUCHANANOFF shows us a very pleasant picture. The
       prisoners seem to have very little to do save to preserve
       the life of the Governor, and to talk heroics about liberty
       and other kindred subjects. <i>Prince Zosimoff</i> attempts,
       for the fourth or fifth time, to make <i>Anna</i> his
       own&mdash;he calls the pursuit "a caprice," and it is indeed
       a strange one&mdash;and is, in the nick of time, arrested,
       by order of the CZAR. After this pleasing and natural little
       incident, everyone prepares to go back to St. Petersburg,
       with the solitary exception of the Prince, who is ordered
       off to the Mines. No doubt the Emperor of RUSSIA had used
       the tooth-powder, and, finding it distasteful to him, had
       taken speedy vengeance upon its presumed inventor.</p>

    <p>I have but one fault to find with the representation. The
    play is capital, the scenery excellent, and the acting beyond
    all praise. But I am not quite sure about the title. M.
    BUCHANANOFF calls his play "<i>The</i> Sixth
    <i>Commandment</i>"&mdash;he would have been, in my opinion,
    nearer the mark, had he brought it into closer association with
    the Ninth!</p>

    <p>Believe me, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,</p>

    <p>Yours, respectfully,</p>

    <p>RUSS IN URBE.</p>

    <p>"Suppose, TOBY dear boy," said the Member for Sark, "we
    start a garden, and work in it ourselves. TEMPLE did it, you
    know, when he was tired of affairs of State."</p>

    <p>"Sir RICHARD?" I asked, never remembering to have seen the
    Member for Evesham in the company of a rake.</p>

    <p>"No; CHARLES THE SECOND's Minister, who went down to Sheen
    two centuries before the Orleanist Princes, and grew roses. Of
    course I don't mean to be there much in the Session. The thing
    is to have something during Recess to gently engage the mind
    and fully occupy the body."</p>

    <p>This conversation took place towards the end of last Session
    but one. By odd coincidence I had met the Member for Sark as I
    was coming from OLD MORALITY's room, where I had been quietly
    dining with him, JACKSON and AKERS-DOUGLAS made up party of
    four. It was second week of August; everybody tired to death.
    OLD MORALITY asked me to look in and join them about eight
    o'clock. Knocked at door; no answer; curious scurrying going
    round; somebody running and jumping; heard OLD MORALITY's
    voice, in gleeful notes, "Now then, DOUGLAS, tuck in your
    tuppenny! Here you are, JACKSON! keep the mill a goin'!"
    Knocked again; no answer; opened door gently; beheld strange
    sight. The Patronage Secretary was "giving a back" to the FIRST
    LORD of the TREASURY. OLD MORALITY, taking running jump,
    cleared it with surprising agility considering AKERS-DOUGLAS'S
    inches. Then he trotted on a few paces, folded his arms and
    bent his head; Financial Secretary to Treasury, clearing
    AKERS-DOUGLAS, took OLD MORALITY in his stride, and "tucked in
    his tuppenny" in turn.</p>

    <p>Thought I had better retire. Seemed on the whole the
    proceedings demanded privacy; but OLD MORALITY, catching sight
    of me, called out, "Come along, TOBY! Only our little game.
    Fall in, and take your turn."</p>

    <p>Rather afraid of falling over, but didn't like to spoil
    sport; cleared OLD MORALITY capitally; scrambled over
    AKERS-DOUGLAS; but couldn't manage JACKSON.</p>

    <p>"I can't get over him," I said, apologetically.</p>

    <p>"No," said AKERS-DOUGLAS, "he's a Yorkshireman."</p>

    <p>"'Tis but a primitive pastime," observed OLD MORALITY, when,
    later, we sat down to dinner; "but remarkably refreshing; a
    great stimulant for the appetite. Indeed," he added, as he
    transferred a whole grouse to his plate, "I do not know
    anything that more forcibly brings home to the mind the truth
    underlying the old Greek aphorism, that a bird on your plate is
    worth two in the dish."</p>

    <p>I gathered in conversation that when business gets a little
    heavy, when time presses, and leisure for exercise is
    curtailed, OLD MORALITY generally has ten minutes leap-frog
    before dinner.</p>

    <p>"We used at first to play it in the corridor; an excellent
    place; apparently especially designed for the purpose; but we
    were always liable to interruption, and by putting the chairs
    on the table here we manage well enough. It's been the making
    of me, and I may add, has enabled my Right Hon. friends with
    increased vigour and ease to perform their duty to their QUEEN
    and Country. The great thing, dear TOBY, is to judiciously
    commingle physical exercise with mental activity. What says the
    great bard of Abydos? <i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i>, which
    being translated means, mens&mdash;or perhaps I should say,
    men&mdash;should incorporate bodily exercise with mental
    exercitation."</p>

    <p>Of course I did not disclose to the Member for Sark, what
    had taken place in the privity of OLD MORALITY's room. That is
    not my way. The secret is ever sacred with me, and shall be
    carried with me to the silent tomb. But I was much impressed
    with the practical suggestions of my esteemed Leader, and
    allured by their evident effect upon his appetite.</p>

    <p>"Men," continued the Member for Sark, moodily, "do all kinds
    of things in the Recess to make up for the inroads on the
    constitution suffered during the Session. They go to La
    Bourboule like the MARKISS and RAIKES; or they play Golf like
    Prince ARTHUR; or they pay visits to their Mothers-in-law in
    the United States, like CHAMBERLAIN and LYON PLAYFAIR; or they
    go to Switzerland, India, Russia, Australia, and Sierra Leone.
    Now if we had a garden, which we dug, and weeded, and clipped,
    and pruned ourselves, never eating a potato the sapling of
    which we had not planted, watered, and if necessary grafted,
    with our own hands, we should live happy, healthful lives for
    at least a month or two, coming back to our work having renewed
    our youth like the rhinoceros."</p>

    <p>"But you don't know anything about gardening, do you?"</p>

    <p>"That's just it. Anyone can keep a garden that has been
    brought up to the business. But look what chances there are
    before two statesmen of, I trust I may say without egotism,
    average intelligence, who take to gardening without, as you may
    say, knowing anything about it. Think of the charm of being
    able to call a spade a Hoe! without your companion, however
    contentious, capping the exclamation. Then think of the long
    vista of possible surprises. You dig a trench, and I gently
    sprinkle seed in it&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Excuse me," I said, "but supposing <i>I</i> sprinkle the
    seed, and <i>you</i> dig the trench?"</p>

    <p>"&mdash;The seed is carrot, let us suppose," the Member for
    Sark continued, disregarding my interruption, his fine face
    aglow with honest enthusiasm. "I, not being an adept, feeling
    my way, as it were, towards the perfection of knowledge, put in
    the seed the wrong end up, and, instead of the carrots
    presenting themselves to the earnest inquirer in what is, I
    believe, the ordinary fashion, with the green tops showing
    above the generous earth, and the spiral, rosy-tinted,
    cylindrical form hidden in the soil, the limb were to grow out
    of the ground, its head downward; would that be nothing, do you
    think? I mention that only as a possibility that flashed across
    my mind. There are an illimitable series of possibilities that
    might grow out of Our Garden. Of course we don't mean to make
    money out of it. It's only fair to you, TOBY, that I should, at
    the outset, beg you to hustle out of your mind any sordid ideas
    of that kind. What we seek is, health and honest occupation,
    and here they lie open to our hand."</p>

    <p>This conversation, as I mentioned, took place a little more
    than a year ago. I was carried away, as the House of Commons
    never is, by my Hon. friend's eloquence. We got the garden. We
    have it now; but I do not trust myself on this page to dwell on
    the subject.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
